 </h3>

   Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
  <br>
   Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
 <br>
   Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. 
  <br>
   The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
